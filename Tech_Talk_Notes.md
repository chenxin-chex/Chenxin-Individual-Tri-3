# Tech Talk Notes

## TT1 (Linked Lists)
Linked lists, queus, stacks are fundamental data structures. Implements ...
 - Generic Type T: applicable to different objects. Can use multiple data types without multiple stacks and queus for each
 - Interable interface: enhanced for loop

**Queus:** are first in first out (FIFO): there is a head and tail pointer, where head stays constant and tail changes as things are added, but head changes and tail is constant as things are removed. Enqueu and Dequeu

**Stacks:** are last in first out (LIFO): use push and pop

**Linked lists:** Queus has a linked list. Data is the objects, the next node would be the next object.

## TT0 (Data Structures)
### Paradigms
Paradigms are a strategy to be followed for writing software applications
 - **Imperative paradigms:** Uses statements to change a program's state. Imperative programs are built from procedures and a series of commands to perform a task.
 - **Object Oriented paradigms:** Uses classes as blueprints to make objects out of. These class structures can be reused, and Java follows OOP.

### Data Structures
Some common data structures that java uses to store information include: Array lists, hashmaps, and algorithms (such as recursion).
