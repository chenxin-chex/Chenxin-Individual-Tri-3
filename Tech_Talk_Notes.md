## TT0 (Data Structures)
### Paradigms
Paradigms are a strategy to be followed for writing software applications
 - **Imperative paradigms:** Uses statements to change a program's state. Imperative programs are built from procedures and a series of commands to perform a task.
 - **Object Oriented paradigms:** Uses classes as blueprints to make objects out of. These class structures can be reused, and Java follows OOP.

### Data Structures
Some common data structures that java uses to store information include: Array lists, hashmaps, and algorithms (such as recursion).
