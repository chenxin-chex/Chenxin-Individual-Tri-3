## Week 1 (Stacks & Queues)
**Challenge 1 (in [Queue.java](https://github.com/chenxin-chex/Chenxin-Individual-Tri-3/blob/main/Queue.java)):** Wrote the delete method for queue by setting new head and connecting tail as node

Difficulty printing out the queues so I changed addList and coded deleteList in QueueManager

**Challenge 2 (in [Merge.java](https://github.com/chenxin-chex/Chenxin-Individual-Tri-3/blob/main/Merge.java)):** Created merge method to combine and sort two queues

Difficulty merging the entire queue because next() method of QueueIterator skipped over data

**Challenge 3 (in [Stack.java](https://github.com/chenxin-chex/Chenxin-Individual-Tri-3/blob/main/Stack.java)):** Created stack class that follows the last in first out principle with methods push and pop

Difficulty testing the stack to reverse a queue (didn't finish in time)

## Week 0 (Data Structures)
### [Week 0 Review Ticket](https://github.com/dsblack0/stickers_for_charity/issues/7)
**Challenge 1 (in [Main.java](https://github.com/chenxin-chex/Chenxin-Individual-Tri-3/blob/main/Main.java)):** Used Hashmap data structure in order to dynamically create and store options

Used try and catch method in order to print "Please enter a number listed in the menu." instead of causing error if the input isn't in the menu.

**Challenge 2 (in [IntByReference.java](https://github.com/chenxin-chex/Chenxin-Individual-Tri-3/blob/main/IntByReference.java)):** Java can only call by value for parameters in a method, but variable "value" can be changed since the method is called within the object a. For object b, parameter "what" has to be updated using a method in order to change the reference.

toString() method returns the integer variable "value" as a String.

**Challenge 3 (in [Matrix.java](https://github.com/chenxin-chex/Chenxin-Individual-Tri-3/blob/main/Matrix.java)):** toString() method iterates over the 2d array using enhanced for loops in order to return the 2d array as a String
